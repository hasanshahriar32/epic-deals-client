                What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
              <strong>Local Component State:</strong> Each React component has its own local state managed through the useState hook. This allows components to hold and update their specific state independently. State changes trigger component re-rendering.
                <br />
              <strong>Context API: </strong> Reacts Context API provides a way to share state across multiple components without passing props explicitly at each level.
                <br />
              <strong>Redux:</strong> Redux is a state management library commonly used with React applications. It maintains a global state store, and components

              <strong>React Query:</strong> React Query is a library primarily focused on managing remote data and caching. It handles fetching, caching, and synchronization of data with the server.

                 How does prototypical inheritance work?
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                
                Prototypical inheritance is a concept used in object-oriented programming to implement inheritance between objects. It is primarily associated with languages like JavaScript, which are prototype-based rather than class-based.
                <br />
               
                <br />
                In prototypical inheritance, each object in JavaScript has an internal property called the prototype. This prototype property references another object, often referred to as the "prototype object." When accessing a property or method on an object, if the object itself does not have that property, JavaScript automatically looks for it in its prototype object. This process continues recursively up the prototype chain until the property is found or until the end of the chain is reached (i.e., the prototype is null).

              What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?

              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
              A unit test is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying the correctness of individual units or components of a software system. A unit, in this context, refers to the smallest testable part of an application, usually a function or a method. <br />
              <strong>Code Quality Assurance: </strong>  Unit tests act as a safety net, allowing developers to catch and fix bugs early in the development process. 
                <br />
              <strong>Code Refactoring and Modification:</strong> Unit tests provide confidence when making changes to the code. When refactoring or modifying a unit, running the associated unit tests ensures that the intended functionality is not inadvertently broken. 
              <br />
              <strong>Documentation and Code Understanding: </strong>  Unit tests serve as living documentation for the codebase. They provide clear examples of how a unit of code should be used and what results are expected.

              React vs. Angular vs. Vue?
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
              React, Angular, and Vue are popular JavaScript frameworks used for building web applications. Here's a comparison of these frameworks:
                <br />

                <strong>React: </strong>  React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook. It focuses on the component-based approach, where the UI is divided into reusable components. React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components. 
                <br />

                <strong>Angular: </strong>Angular is a full-fledged JavaScript framework developed by Google. It follows a component-based architecture and provides a comprehensive set of features for building complex applications. Angular uses TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, 
                <br />

                <strong>Vue: </strong>Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework created by Evan You. It is known for its simplicity and easy learning curve. Vue follows a component-based approach similar to React and Angular but with a more flexible and intuitive API. It provides a reactive data binding system, a template syntax, and optional integrations with other libraries.
                <br />
                Scalability: Angular provides a more opinionated structure and built-in tools for building large-scale applications. React and Vue are more flexible and can be scaled effectively, but they may require additional libraries and patterns to handle complex state management. <br />

              Compare Django, Ruby on Rails, and Express.js for web development?
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
              Django, Ruby on Rails, and Express.js are popular frameworks used for web development. Here's a comparison of these frameworks:
                <br />

                <strong>Django: </strong>  Django is a high-level Python web framework known for its "batteries included" philosophy. It provides a robust and scalable framework for building web applications. Django follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and emphasizes the principle of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). It includes features like an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database management, a templating engine, and a built-in administration interface.
                <br />

                <strong>Ruby on Rails: </strong>Ruby on Rails, often referred to as Rails, is a web application framework written in Ruby. Rails follows the MVC pattern and embraces convention over configuration. It provides a set of libraries and tools that simplify web development tasks,
                <br />

                <strong>Express.js:</strong>Express.js is a minimalistic and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It is lightweight and unopinionated, allowing developers to have more control over the application's structure and architecture. Express.js provides a simple and intuitive API for handling HTTP requests and defining routes. 
                <br />
                <strong>Language:</strong> Django is based on Python, Ruby on Rails is based on Ruby, and Express.js is based on JavaScript (Node.js). Consider your familiarity with these languages and the available resources for each.
